# HelpingHand

#Helping Hand is a Web Application that helps its users locate service providers of all kinds in the area near them.

#Every user must create an account when they first use Helping Hand. The process asks for users for their Name, Phone Number, Email, whether they want to become a service provider or only use other peopl'e services, and what type of service they want to provide if they decide to become a service providor. They are also asked to create a username and a password, which are used to log in to the application after their first use.

#Upon Log in, the user is directed to the Dashboard. A brief page description is located in the center of the screen. In the dashboard, the users can 1. request a service 2. View your Pending Requests 3. View your completed/confirmed requests 4. Change your personal Preferences 5. Log out

#The request a service page asks for the user location using geolocation which obtains the users latitude and longitude. The map uses these coordinates to focus in on the user location. There are twelve people listed on this page, each of which that can provide a service. The map contains many markers to show the proximity of these other people. Selecting the different markers/people will popup a box displaying the person's name, skills, how much they charge, phone number, and email.

#The View Your Pending Requests page displays all your requests that are waiting response from the provider, in discussion with the provider, and/or awaiting your approval. In this page, the list of pending requests are supposedly to be pulled form a database and changes dynamically based on other relavant actions, such as requesting a new service. For the sake of demo, a text file was used to imitate the database.

#The View Your Complete Requests page displays all the requests you have confirmed, and/or completed by the service providor. Once the details of a service are agreed upon by both parties, it will go under the Completed Requests page. After the service provider has completed the service, the user can choose to delete the service from this page or keep them for future reference.

#The Personal Preference Page allows the users to change their account settings. In this page, the user can change their Name, Contact Information, as well as whether to become a service provider or no.

#The Log Out Function allows the users to log out and log in as a different user.
